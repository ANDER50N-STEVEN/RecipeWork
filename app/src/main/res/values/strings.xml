        We are three college students who recognize the difficulty of eating well during these
                college years. \nThis is something we hope that our app can help with.
                \n Our goal is that students with be better able to know what they should buy, as
                well as keeping track of what foods they have.\n With this app, students will no
                longer have to worry about forgetting what food is in their own cupboards, and they
                will better be able to know what it is they could be doing with their food.
                \n Steven Anderson, \n Ankita Dev,\n and Eriqua Eisele
